[cd9eb87 | Thu Jun 25 01:57:03 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * added datamapper 0.10.0 compatibility information to README

[bda6fbc | Thu Jun 25 01:53:38 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * cleaner code for many_to_many deletion

    * also added TODO note about handling this with
      mark_for_destruction like all the other
      relationship kinds.

[bce5322 | Thu Jun 25 00:58:11 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * support deleting of many_to_many associations (all specs pass)

    * Deletion is currently triggered when calling the nested
      attribute writer. This is most probably not desired and
      is likely to change.

    * Example:

      Person.has(n, :projects, :through => :project_memberships)
      @person.projects_attributes = {
        :id => project.id, :_delete => true
      }

      This will delete the associated project_membership
      and then the project

[a8f2a9a | Wed Jun 24 15:52:48 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * mark_for_destruction? now really returns true or false (not nil)

[8127032 | Wed Jun 24 15:44:27 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * corrected specs for atomic commits

    * those specs aren't really shared, but only valid
      for situations with no :reject_if guard that returns
      true.

    * only 1 spec failing now and that's deleting
      has(n, :through)

[226a5a6 | Wed Jun 24 04:00:41 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * added hopefully last missing documentation

[51b5fdb | Wed Jun 24 03:54:41 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * finished documenting all modules and methods

    * also fixed a bug where attributes weren't sent
      to the :reject_if guard in case the guard was
      specified as Symbol or String.

[faeaf5b | Wed Jun 24 02:05:08 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * #save_self no overwritten on every resource

    * this makes more deletion specs pass and is actually
      really obvious. wonder why it took me so long.

    * still a few atomic commits related specs failing
      but slowly getting there.

    * also, this needs my current dm-validations work
      available at
      http://github.com/snusnu/dm-more/commits/validation_context_work

[2582c12 | Wed Jun 24 02:02:36 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * docfixes and a minor internal implementation change

[097bf9d | Wed Jun 24 02:01:13 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * minor internal method renaming.

    * actually, i'm considering refactoring this method
    * i don't like the name, it already indicates that
      this methods serves 2 purposes which isn't good.

[5cd44f9 | Wed Jun 24 01:58:52 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * no need to name useless rest arguments

    * in fact, it may very well be safe to remove them
      altogether. think more about this.

[666ee63 | Wed Jun 24 01:57:56 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * use mysql in specs since dm-constraints are broken for sqlite3

[92d25ff | Wed Jun 24 01:57:37 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * use dm-constraints in specs for more safety

[9c5f2af | Wed Jun 17 16:16:00 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * updated Manifext.txt and gemspec to reflect the current structure

[717d870 | Tue Jun 16 13:17:34 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * adapted to latest dm-core

    * still the same specs failing

[0ae2f1a | Mon Jun 15 15:02:02 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * less invasive dm-core overwrite in Resource#save_parents

    * i don't know if that's the best way, but it works for now

[dc188ee | Mon Jun 15 15:01:06 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * minor spec refactoring to run the shared examples all the time

[a14e6fd | Sat Jun 13 16:07:36 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * made all but 3 specs pass

    * this means that all specs except those that test
      destroying of an associated resource via the
      nested attribute accessors, works.

    * TODO this spec change needs more thinking. I'm
      not yet sure if not creating a Person in this case
      is the right behavior.

[8de57d1 | Sat Jun 13 16:05:44 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * adapt overwritten save behavior to latest dm-core changes

[e3837fe | Sat Jun 13 16:05:18 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * don't use chainable in client code

    * it should be sufficient that dm-core declared
      the method as chainable

[4121c57 | Sat Jun 13 16:04:26 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * removed debug statements

 * specs now explicitly assign related resources to the association

[04a87ad | Thu Jun 04 15:44:20 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * removed unneeded assertions

    * deleting a related resource still not working
    * transactions still not working

    * other than that, it seems quite fine

[6a2e07f | Tue Jun 02 20:17:56 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * include save behavior only if a resource accepts nested attributes

[d2c27c6 | Tue Jun 02 19:59:41 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * spec formatting and useless assertion removal

 * added a few TODO and FIXME comments

[a317852 | Tue Jun 02 19:05:20 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * moved shared specs to spec/shared directory.

    * this reduces clutter from the main specs
    * also it will hopefully help with refactoring
      the specs to provide better shared specs that
      can be used for all integrations specs

 * moved rspec_tmbundle_support to spec/lib

 * nice formatting for spec fixtures.

[4c18a35 | Tue Jun 02 17:55:25 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * use parent saving behavior for *all* resources.

    * breaks lots of specs that were already passing
    * i don't know why this is, but nevertheless i think
      that this is probably the way to go.

[653f615 | Tue Jun 02 17:33:15 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

      work for has_1_specs.

      at the same spec (deleting the related resource). i wonder
      why that is ...

 * bypass needless calls to association_name all the time

    * key options_for_nested_attributes by relationship
      instead of association_name. this eliminates the
      need to repeatedly fetch the relationship by its
      name and provides more concise codes in general.

    * removed the relationship method since it's not
      needed anymore

    * removed the reject_new_nested_attributes_guard_for
      method since it's not needed anymore

    * number of passing specs is still the same

[dd859c3 | Thu May 28 04:12:44 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

[da2d474 | Thu May 28 02:21:15 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * explicitly include plugin functionality

    * don't alter existing datamapper api by simply
      requiring files. instead, do it explicitly as
      this also serves a documentation puropose since
      it's more obvious what's going on.

[ae50006 | Wed May 27 23:31:47 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * every case statement wants an else branch

    * although the plugin will guarantee not to enter
      this code path, who knows what people try to do.
      it's a (private) method, so someone could use
      it in a possibly wrong way so why not inform
      him/her if that happens.

    * also, i think that the use of 'next' instead of
      deeply nested if/unless/case reads nicer

[38ece56 | Wed May 27 23:17:36 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * cleaned up weird condition syntax

[9a6318c | Wed May 27 19:10:20 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * better usage of RelationshipAccess

    * it's not necessary to call relationship! from
      inside accepts_nested_attributes_for.
      The association_name is *definitely* valid at
      this time.

[6e8c49f | Wed May 27 18:20:47 UTC 2009] snusnu <gamsnjaga@gmail.com>

 * model extension now less invasive and easier to extend

    * Added relationship/relationship! methods to
      provide a cleaner interface to the relationships
      defined on a model. This hides the implementation
      detail that relationships are stored in a hash
      which is bound to change anyway. Also, it allows
      to *fail fast* when trying to access a relationship
      that is not defined in a model (via relationship!)

    * restructured the files to better encapsulate and
      communicate what's in them.

    * better use of dm-core methods allowed previously
      explicitly declared methods to be removed.

 * removed fixtures and specs for customized has(n, :through) associations.

    It makes no sense to spec all different options for the association
    macros in integration specs. Rather, it should be specced once and
    for all (in unit specs) that dm-accepts_nested_attributes infers the
    right kind of associations. Think about it, then do it!

      investigate this
    * dbussink also suggested it might be a good idea to add an option
      that allows to turn transaction usage off.
    * also, look for some api to infer wether a backend supports
      (nested) transactions or not. we could default to true if it does,
      but still leave the option to turn it off nevertheless.

 * initial support for dm-validations

    * this desperately needs specs! currently only basic not null
      constraint specs pass (well, there are no other).
    * saving a resource along with its associations should always
      be done inside a transaction! figure out how to do that!
    * validation errors from associated resources should be copied
      to the parent resource. this currently happens, but it's not
      specced at all so consider the behavior undefined.

 * added get_#{association_name} helper for (many/one)_to_one associations.

    This is mainly to support common usecases in fields_for. This method
    will return a new record if the associated object is nil at the time
    it is accessed, and the associated object otherwise. This should help
    fields_for to render the right id and name attributes for the input
    fields. This method is not generated for (one/many)_to_many associations
    since these return an Collection anyway and this allow to call build
    or get on it. A possible use case would look something like this:

    <% fields_for @location.get_geo_point do %>
     ...
    <% end =%>

    The whole purpose of this commit is to provide something to fields_for
    that is guaranteed to not be nil.
