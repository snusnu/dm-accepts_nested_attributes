      # Consider a situation with a belongs_to association where both a valid value
      # for the foreign_key attribute *and* nested_attributes for a new record are
      # present (i.e. item_type_id and item_type_attributes are present).
      # Also see http://is.gd/sz2d on the rails-core ml for a discussion on this.
      # The basic idea is, that there should be a well defined behavior for what
      # exactly happens when such a situation occurs. I'm currently in favor for
      # using the foreign_key if it is present, but this probably needs more thinking.

          # why this shouldn't save, after getting tests to run and ensuring
          # coverage for this.
          # The DataMapper paradigm is that if I call @object.attributes =
          # some_hash, that's explicitly saying "update the attributes but
          # don't save yet." If I wanted to update and save at the same time,
          # I'd call @object.update(some_hash).  The line below breaks that
          # paradigm: if the hash contains attributes for associations, this
          # method automatically saves them.
          # This is broken because:
          # - I no longer have the option of using `attributes=` without
          # saving the associations; `update` and `attributes=` do the same
          # thing as far as nested resources are concerned
          # - Saving here is unnecessary anyway. If we simply don't save,
          # calling save on the parent object will save these associations
          # anyway, per the DataMapper documentation:
          # 
          # >>  It is important to note that #save will save the complete loaded
          # >>  object graph when called. This means that calling #save on a
          # >>  resource that has relationships of any kind (established via
          # >>  belongs_to or has) will also save those related resources, if
          # >>  they are loaded at the time #save is being called. Related
          # >>  resources are loaded if they've been accessed either for read or
          # >>  for write purposes, prior to #save being called.  contains
          # >>  attributes for nested resorces
          #
          # - Finally, saving here makes it impossible to use DataMapper's
          # global `Model.raise_on_save_failure` setting, because as soon as
          # one of these associations fails to save, the process of building
          # the others is aborted. In a Rails controller, I want to do:
          #
          # @foo.attributes = params[:foo_attributes]
          # begin
          #   @foo.save
          #   redirect_to someplace
          # rescue
          #   render :new, alert: t('flash.save_failed')
          #
          # With `raise_on_save_failure`, this ensures that all associations
          # were saved before we continue. However, if `attributes=` tries
          # to save each associated object before I call `@foo.save`, the
          # first invalid one short-circuts the process and the other objects
          # never get built, which means they can't be displayed with errors
          # when we re-render the form.
          #
          # For all of these reasons, the save below is commented out. Later,
          # we should delete it and contribute it back if possible.
